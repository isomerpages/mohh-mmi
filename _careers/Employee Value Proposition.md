### Employee Value Proposition

MOHH’s Employee Value Proposition describes clearly how we value our staff and what our staff view as important for their growth with our organisation. It is encapsulated in three pillars: Contribution, Careers and Care. Contribution outlines the meaningful and exciting work for us that contributes towards building the future of Singapore’s healthcare. Careers summarises the development of professional expertise and provision of diverse opportunities for all of us to fulfill potential and aspirations. Care is all about caring for all of us as part of our MOHH family.​
