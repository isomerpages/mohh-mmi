MOH Holdings (MOHH) has noted WhatsApp messages circulating that claim to be from MOHH or CPF Board. These unsolicited messages contain inaccurate information about CareShield Life, the national long-term care insurance scheme and may contain links to external/fake websites. 

MOHH will never send WhatsApp messages to request for sensitive personal information. Be aware of fake links with misspelled domain names and/or fake domains. When not sure, always access information from the official website at [www.careshieldlife.gov.sg](http://www.careshieldlife.gov.sg/). We also advise that you do not forward or circulate such unsubstantiated messages. 

Messages from government agencies such as CPF Board may contain links to websites. To ensure legitimacy, users should always check that the domain of such links end with ".gov.sg" before clicking on them.

If you have any doubts, please contact [info@mohh.com.sg](mailto:info@mohh.com.sg).
