Community Involvement Programmes (CIP), both locally and overseas, are important components of our Scholar Development Framework. </p><p>MOHH organises about five overseas CIPs or OCIP annually to ASEAN or South Asian countries. Each expedition last about 5 to 7 days and serves the local communities (for example medical needs, education, the building of shelters and the provision of amenities). Apart from building their community spirit, the expedition also enhances the character development of our scholars through experiential learning, and develops their global awareness and cultural sensitivities. </p> 
   <br> To date, our scholars have served communities in Cambodia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka. 
   <h4>Partnerships</h4><p>MOHH has collaborated with several Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and Volunteer Welfare Organisations (VWOs) to coordinate the OCIP. Their expertise and help have been invaluable.</p><p>We welcome partnerships with other NGOs and VWOs for our OCIP. For more details, please email us at
